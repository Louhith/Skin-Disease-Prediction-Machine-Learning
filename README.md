# Skin-Disease-Predection-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on skin disease prediction. Skin diseases are a common health concern, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. 

Features
Utilizes machine learning techniques to classify skin disease types from images.
Incorporates a combination of tabular data (age, sex, etc.) and image data for prediction.
Explores various neural network architectures to achieve optimal accuracy.
Provides data preprocessing and augmentation pipelines for enhancing model performance.
Demonstrates the use of transfer learning with pretrained CNN architectures (like VGG16).
Supports easy customization and extension for other medical image classification tasks.
